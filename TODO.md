- In the event detail screen:
  - I want to see the recurrence pattern of an event (e.g.: every Tuesday, every 2nd Sunday at 6pm, every Monday and Wednesday at 10am, etc.).
  - I want to see a graph of the event's value over time (a line graph will do).

BUGS:
- Events with no samples are placed at the bottom of the list. They should be placed on top, or into a special region in the list.
